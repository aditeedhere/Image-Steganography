# Image-Steganography


This project implements image steganography techniques to conceal secret messages within digital images. It allows users to:

Embed confidential text messages into images using a chosen steganography algorithm (e.g., Least Significant Bit - LSB).
Extract hidden messages from steganographic images, making them readable again.
